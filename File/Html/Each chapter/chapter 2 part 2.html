The Computer Generations
A generation refers to the state of improvement in the development of a product. 
This term is also used in the different advancements of computer technology .there are currently 5 generation of computers. 
The computer can be classified in following generation in terms of:</p>
<ol class="orderlist1" >
<li>The technology used by them</li>
<li>Computing characteristics</li>
<li>Physical appearance and </li>
<li>	their application</li></ol>



<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>First Generation of Computers (1946-1958):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">

The first generation computers were used during 1946-1958. 
They were based on vacuum tubes. Vaccum  tube was extremely important step in advancement of computer.
 It’s purpose was to act like a amplifier and switch. Examples of first generation computers are ENIVAC and UNIVAC-1.</p>

<ul class="unorderlist1">Advantages
<li>	Vacuum tubes were the only electronic component available during those days.</li>
<li>	Vacuum tube technology made possible to make electronic digital computers.</li>
<li>These computers could calculate data in millisecond.</li></ul>

<ul class="unorderlist1">Disadvantages
<li>The computers were very large in size.</li>
<li>They consumed a large amount of energy.</li>
<li>They heated very soon due to thousands of vacuum tubes.</li>
<li>They were not very reliable.</li>
<li>Air conditioning was required.</li>
<li>Constant maintenance was required.</li>
<li>Non-portable.</li>
<li>Costly commercial production.</li>
<li>Limited commercial use.</li>
<li>Very slow speed.</li>
<li>Limited programming capabilities</li>
<li>Used machine language only.</li>
<li>Not versatile and very faulty.</li></ul>

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Second Generation of Computers (1959-1964):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">


The second generation computers used transistors.
 The scientists at Bell laboratories developed transistor in 1947.
 These scientists include John Barden, William Brattain and William Shockley. 
 The size of the computers was decreased by replacing vacuum tubes with transistors.  These computer was developed during 1959 -1964.
 The examples of second generation computers are IBM 7094 series, IBM 1400 series and CDC 164 etc.</p>
<ul class="unorderlist1">Advantages
<li>Smaller in size as compared to the first generation computers.</li>
<li>The 2nd generation Computers were more reliable</li>
<li>Used less energy and were not heated.</li>
<li>Wider commercial use</li>
<li>Better portability as compared to the first generation computers.</li>
<li>Better speed and could calculate data in microseconds</li>
<li>Used faster peripherals like tape drives, magnetic disks, printer etc.</li>
<li>Used Assembly language instead of Machine language.</li>
<li>Accuracy improved.</li></ul>

<ul class="unorderlist1">Disadvantages
<li>Cooling system was required</li>
<li>Constant maintenance was required</li>
<li>Commercial production was difficult</li>
<li>Only used for specific purposes</li>
<li>Costly and not versatile</li>
<li>Punch cards were used for input.</li></ul>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Third Generation of Computers (1965-1974):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">

Third generation computers used the integrated circuits (IC).
 Jack Kilby developed the concept of integrated circuit in 1958.
 It was an important invention in the computer field.
 The first IC was invented and used in 1961.
 The size of an IC is about ¼ square inch. 
 A single IC chip may contain thousands of transistors. 
 The computer became smaller in size, faster, more reliable and less expensive.
 The examples of third generation computers are IBM 370, IBM System/360,UNIVAC 1108 and UNIVAC AC 9000 etc.</p>
<ul class="unorderlist1">Advantages
<li>Smaller in size as compared to previous generations.</li>
<li>More reliable.</li>
<li>Used less energy</li>
<li>Produced less heat as compared to the previous two generations of computers.</li>
<li>Better speed and could calculate data in nanoseconds.</li>
<li>Used fan for heat discharge to prevent damage.</li>
<li>Maintenance cost was low because hardware failure </li>
<li>Totally general purpose</li>
<li>Could be used for high-level languages.</li>
<li>Good storage</li>
<li>Versatile to an extent</li>
<li>Less expensive</li>
<li>Better accuracy</li>
<li>Commercial production increased.</li>
<li>Used mouse and keyboard for input.</li></ul>
<ul class="unorderlist1">Disadvantages
<li>	Air conditioning was required.</li></ul>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Fourth Generation of Computers (1975-1990):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">

The fourth generation computers started with the invention of Microprocessor. 
The Microprocessor contains thousands of ICs. Ted Hoff produced the first microprocessor in 1971 for Intel. 
It was known as Intel 4004. The technology of integrated circuits improved rapidly. 
The LSI (Large Scale Integration) circuit and VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuit was designed. 
It greatly reduced the size of computer. The size of modern Microprocessors is usually one square inch. 
It can contain millions of electronic circuits. The examples of fourth generation computers are Apple Macintosh & IBM PC.</p>
<ul class="unorderlist1">Advantages
<li>More powerful and reliable than previous generations.</li>
<li>Small in size</li>
<li>Fast processing power with less power consumption</li>
<li>Fan for heat discharging and thus to keep cold.</li>
<li>No air conditioning required.</li>
<li>Cheapest among all generations</li>
<li>All types of High level languages can be used in this type of computers</li>
<li>LSI and VLSI technology used</li></ul>

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Fifth Generation of Computers (1990- till now):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Scientists are working hard on the 5th generation computers with quite a few breakthroughs.
It is based on the technique of Artificial Intelligence (AI). 
Computers can understand spoken words & imitate human reasoning.
Can respond to its surroundings using different types of sensors.
Scientists are constantly working to increase the processing power of computers.
They are trying to create a computer with real IQ with the help of advanced programming and technologies Students.
The advancement in modern technologies will revolutionize the computer in future.</p>
