<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Introduction:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
System is a set of detailed methods , procedures and routines created to carry out 
a specific activity , perform a duty ,or solve a problem. It is a set of various 
functional components of a computer that are interconnected in some fashion to 
achieve the basic function of the computer , that is to execute programs. It 
consists of I/O components , memory and CPU with one or more modules of each type.
It takes a set of inputs , process them and create a set of outputs. A computer 
system function effectively only when all these  components perform 
their assigned task. The failure of any one component of the system leads to the failure 
of whole system.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Input device:</i></u></p>

<p class="Text">
Input is any data or instructions you enter into the memory of a computer .
Once input is in memory , the CPU access it and process the input into 
output . Four types of input are data , programs , command and user responses.
The device that takes in data and program instructions and converts them into 
digital form is called input device.<br>
Input device perform the following basic function:
</p> 
<ul class="unorderlist1">
<li>It accept data from user.</li>
<li>It convert data into binary code that is understandable to the computer</li>
<li>It send data in binary form to the computer for further processing</li>
Keyboard , mouse , joystick , light pen , scanner and touch screen  are some of the popular input device.</ul>

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Central Processing Unit:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Central Processing Unit(CPU) is the main information processor in a digital computer capable of executing a program. 
CPU also referred to as a central processor unit , is the hardware within a computer that is also responsible for carrying 
out the processing job. It is a brain of the computer. It is where all the searching , sorting , calculating and decision 
making takes place. It guides , directs and controls a computer's performance. The processing capability of a PC is measured 
in terms of the amount of data processed by its CPU in one operation. The speed of the CPU is measured in MegaHertz(MHz). The 
various type of CPU chips are Pentium IV , Intel Cerelon , Cyrix and AMD Duron . It has 2 component:
</p>
<ol class="orderlist1" type="a">
<li>Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU)</li>
<li>Control Unit(CU)</li></ol>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Arithmetic Logic Unit(ALU):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
The ALU of the CPU is the place where the actual execution of instruction take place during the processing operation.
It is a multi operational digital circuit performing the arithmetic operations on integer(whole number) and real
(with a decimal point) operands. It can also perform simple logical tests for equality , greater than and less than between operands. 
It contains the accumulator , the temporary register ,logical and arithmetic and logical circuit.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Control Unit(CU):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
The CU is the logical hub of the CPU. It directs and coordinates the activities of the entire computer.It consists of registers (which 
are memory locations similar to primary memory ,but located in CPU) to hold  address of the current instruction being executed , 
the current instruction itself and circuitry to decode the current instruction and take necessary action. 
The CU consists of several registers like address register , instruction register , sequence register and decoder. 
When a program is executed a number of steps are to be followed by computer system.</p>
 <ul class="unorderlist1">
  <li>The instruction selected by the sequence register and set to the instruction register.</li>
  <li>The operation part of the instruction is sent to the decoder and address part is sent to the address register.</li>
  <li>The CU issues order to extract the contents from the address and transfer them to ALU . Also the instruction like multiply 
  or divide also goes to ALU</li>
  <li>The sequence register moves onto the next instruction. The process of fetching the instruction and sending its parts to appropriate 
  registers constitutes the fetch cycle. The calculation of the result after performing the required arithmetic or logic operation 
  is called execution cycle</li></ul>

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Primary memory:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Primary memory is computer memory that a processor or computer accesses first or directly. 
It allows a processor to access running execution applications and services that are temporarily stored in a specific memory location.
Primary memory is also known as primary storage or main memory.It is divided into 2 parts:</p>
<ol class="orderlist1">
<li>Random Access Memory(RAM)</li>
<li>Read Only Memory(ROM)</li></ol>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Random Access Memory(RAM):</i></u></p>

<p class="Text">
RAM is the most important form of memory whose bytes or memory locations are open and accessible to the user.
 It is called random access memory because of its ability to access memory because of its ability to 
 access each byte of data directly. The purpose of RAM is to hold a copy of operating system , currently executing programs and data.
  The capacity of the RAM is usually measured in MegaBytes(MB).</p>
  <ul class="unorderlist1">
  <li>Static Random Access Memory</li>
  <li>Dynamic Random Access Memory</li></ul>
 <p class="Topic" align="left"><u><b>Static Random Access Memory:</b></u></p> 
<p class="Text">
SRAM is a fast memory technology that requires power to hold its content.
 It is used for high speed register , caches and relatively small memory 
 banks such as frame buffer on a display adapter. SRAM has a low bit density 
 , high power consumption and is more expensive. SRAM chips have access times ranging from 
 10 to 30 nanosecond.</p>
<p class="Topic" align="left"><u><b>Dynamic Random Access Memory:</b></u></p> 
<p class="Text">
  DRAM is a read write random access memory whose storage cells are based on 
  transistor-capacitor combinations , in which the digital information is represented 
  by charges that are stored on the capacitors and must be repeatedly refresed in order 
  to retain the information. The DRAM is cheaper but its access time is slower than that of RAM.
  Most DRAM technology support access times of around 60 nanoseconds.</p>
