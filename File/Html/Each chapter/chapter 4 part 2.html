<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Read Only Memory(ROM):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
ROM is a permanent memory containing special instructions called the ROM BIOS(Basic Input/Output System) 
for detailed computer operations. These instructions tell the computer how to access the hard disk , find the operating system, 
load it into RAM . It is housed in a single integrated circuit which is plugged into the motherboard . 
It is read only memory which means that the CPU can read or retrieve , the programs written on the ROM chip. 
However , the user cannot write or change the information or instruction  in ROM . The contents of the ROM 
are written into at manufacturing time. It is non-volatile in nature ,meaning that its contents are not 
lost when power supply is switched off. There are 3 types of Rom . They are:</p>
<p class="Topic" align="left"><u><b>PROM(Programmable Read Only Memory):</b></u></p> 
<p class="Text">
PROM(Programmable Read Only Memory) is a read only memory that can be modified once by the user . PROM is a way of allowing a user to tailor a microcode 
program using a special machine called PROM programmer. This machine supplies an electric current to specific cells in the ROM 
that effectively blows a fuse in them. The process is known as burning the PROM.</p>
<p class="Topic" align="left"><u><b>EPROM(Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory):</b></u></p> 
<p class="Text">
EPROM(Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) is a programmable read only memory that can be erased and reused. Eraser is caused by shining an 
intense ultraviolet light through a window that is designed into the memory chip.</p>
<p class="Topic" align="left"><u><b>EEPROM(Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) :</b></u></p> 
<p class="Text">
EEPROM(Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) is a user modifiable read only memory that can be 
erased and reprogrammed repeatedly through the application of higher than  normal electrical voltage. 
Unlike EEPROM chips , EEPROMs do not need to be removed from the computer to be modified. However an 
EEPROM chip has to be erased and reprogrammed in its entirety , not selectively. It also has a limited 
life - that is the number of times it can be reprogrammed is limited to tens or hundreds of thousands of times.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Cache Memory:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Cache Memory is extremely fast memory that is built into a computer's CPU or located next to it on a 
seperate chip. The CPU uses cache memory to store instruction that are repeatedly required to run programs , 
improving the overall system speed . The advantage of cache memory is that the CPU does not have to use the 
motherboard's system bus for data transfer. Whenever data must be passed through the system bus ,the data transfer speed 
slows to the motherboard's capability. The CPU can process data much faster by avoiding the bottleneck created by the system bus.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Secondary Memory:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Secondary Memory is a long term memory used to store programs and data for the future reference. It 
supplements the limited storage capacity and volatile characteristics of primary memory. This is because 
secondary memory  is much cheaper than primary storage and the data or programs stored in secondary memory 
will not be lost when electrical power is switched off. It is also known as backing storage or external 
memory . The 2 main types are magnetic disk and optical disk.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Output devices:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Any information that has been processed and comes from a computer or computer device is considered 
output . It might be in the form of the words , numbers , graphics , sounds , videos and animation. The 
device that converts the binary coded data into human acceptable form and presents it to the user in the 
desired form is called output device. It performs following functions:</p>
<ul class="unorderlist1">
<li>It accepts result produced by the computer in binary form</li>
<li>It converts the binary coded data into human acceptable form.</li>
<li>It supplies converted results to the user.</li>
The monitor , printer and graphic plotter are some of the popular output device.</ul>
