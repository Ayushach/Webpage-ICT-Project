<p class="Text">
Application software is a complete ,self contained program that perfors  a specific function directly for the user.It helps the user to work faster,more effiently and more productively.
Application software may be written by a large software house which distributes its produts widely and addresses a general class of problems or may be written by an individual and addresses a particular problem.
<br> Application software is of 2 types.They are:

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Customized software:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Customized software(also known as bespoke software or tailor-made software) is software that is specially developed for some specific organization or other user
It is software that is made just for an individual or business that performs tasks specific to their needs. 
For example, if you had a home business, you may hire someone to create a custom software program to help print and view invoices.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Packaged software:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Packaged software, also called a software package, is software that is often used together, performs similar functions, or includes similar features, and is bundled together as a set of software programs.
 For example, Microsoft Office is packaged software, including multiple software programs used in a home or office, such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Powerpoint. 
 Video and audio editing software may be available as packaged software as well, as they may be used together for editing music and video files used in a movie.
<br>Software programs included in packaged software may be available for purchase individually.
 However, purchasing the packaged software is often cheaper than purchasing each software program separately.
 They are user friendly too.
