<p class="Text">
Computers are becoming more and more an integral part of our lives with each passing year. 
They have invaded our place of work, our schools, and our homes. Computers have already
 revolutionized not only engineering and industry, but also business, education, 
 medicine and space research. Recent last development of computer science and technology 
 has enabled people to live lite of great luxury. Information science and technology has
 become an important part of human’s daily life. These advances make it possible and
 necessary for engineers to use computers to solve complex engineering problems. People
 can solve complicated scientific and engineering problems using high technology
 including sophisticated computer hardware and software, high performance computing
 on heterogeneous platforms, even network computing through internet and intranet.</p>

<p class="Text"> 
A computer is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data) and 
manipulates it for some result based on a program or sequence instructions on how the 
data is to be processed. Complex Computers also include the means for storing data
 (including the program, which is also a form of data) for some necessary duration. 
 A program may be invariable and built into the computer (and called logic circuitry 
 as it is on microprocessors) or different programs may be provided to the computer
 (loaded into its storage by an administrator or user). </br>
 A computer performs four major tasks.They are:</br>
 i)<u>Input</u>:: Input is a term used to refer the data fed into a computer or computer
 program. Input can also be an electrical signal or the energy supplied to a device. Any
 signal going into an electronic system is input. Users enter inputs into the computer 
 through the input device.  </br>
 ii)<u>Processing</u>: Doing calculations on the data supplied by you. The CPU receives 
 inputs from the input devices. It works on the data as per the input instructions 
 and processes it into meaningful information (or the output). </br>
 iii)<u>Output</u>: : The meaningful result produced by the computer. Output of processing 
 is given to the users as a soft/hard copy on output devices.  </br>
 iv)<u>Storage</u>:Storage is the method or action of keeping something for future use. 
 The term storage can also be defined as the maintenance or retention of retrievable 
 data on a computer or any other form of electronic system, or memory.  </br>

 <p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Data $ Information:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">

Data is a collection of raw facts and figures, such as values or measurements. It can be
 numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things. Data
 are manipulated either as values or variables by encoding them into information.
 Information is stimuli that has meaning in some context for its receiver. When 
 information is entered into and stored in a computer, it is generally referred to as 
 data. After processing (such as formatting and printing), output data can again be 
 perceived as information. When information is packaged or used for understanding or
 doing something, it is known as knowledge. </br>

 <p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Features of Computer:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
<u><b><i>SPEED:</i></b></u>
A computer is a very fast device. Inside the system unit, operations occur through 
electronic circuits. When data, instructions and information flow along these circuits, 
they travel at close to the speed of light. It can perform a task in a minute that may
 take days if performed manually. A modern computer can execute millions of instructions
 in one second. The speed of a computer at performing a single operation can be measured
 in terms of:
<ul class="unorderlist1">
 <li>A millisecond (from milli-and second; abbreviation: ms) is a thousandth 
(10<sup>-3</sup> or 1/1,000) of a second. Its symbol is ms. One millisecond is to one second 
as one second is to 16.67 minutes.</li> 

<li>A microsecond 1s an SI unit of time equal to one millionth (10<sup>-6</sup> or 1 / 1,000,000) of
a second. Its symbol is us. One microsecond is to one second as one second is to 11.574
 days.</li> 

<li>A picosecond is an 51 unit of time equal to  10<sup>-12</sup> of a second. That is one trillionth,
or one millionth 0f one millionth of a second, or 0.000 000 000 001 seconds. A picosecond
is to one second as one second is to 31,700 years. </li>

<li> A nanosecond (ns) is an SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second (10<sup>-9</sup> or 
1/1,000,000,000 3). One nanosecond is to one second as one second is to 31.7 years.</li> 
</ul></br>
<p class="Text">
<u><b><i>ACCURACY:</i></b></u>
The computer operates nearly 100% accurately. They can perform calculating with great
 accuracy as their circuits have no mechanical parts to wear and tear. They only execute
 instructions input by man. There may be errors produced by the computers. Sometimes, 
 it is due to the fault in the machine and more often due to ’bugs’ in the programs. If 
 the input data are not correct, this may also lead to incorrect output.
 The computers follow the simple rule of GIGO (Garbage in Garbage Out). </br></br>

<u><b><i>Reliability: </i></b></u>

Computers have high degree of reliability because they carry out the calculations with
 high speed and accuracy. Computers do the calculation repeatedly without making mistakes.
 And their circuits have no mechanical parts to wear and tear like in other machines.
</br></br>
<u><b><i>Power of remembering: </i></b></u>
 A computer can store and recall any amount of information because of its secondary 
storage capability. Every piece of information can be retained as long as desired by
 the user and can be recalled almost instantaneously. Even after several years,
 the information recalled will be as accurate as on the day when it was fed.

</br></br>
<u><b><i>Diligence  </i></b></u>

The computer is a machine, does not suffer from the human traits of Tiredness. 
Nor does it loses concentration even after working continuously for a long time. 
This characteristics is especially useful for those jobs where same tasks is done 
again and again. It can perform long and complex calculations
 with same speed and accuracy from the start till the end.
</br></br>
<u><b><i>Storage  </i></b></u>

The computers have a lot of storage devices which can store a tremendous amount of data. 
Data storage is an essential function of the computer. Second storage devices like hard
 disk and USB pen drives can store a large amount of data permanently.


</br></br>
<u><b><i>Communication  </i></b></u>

Most computers today have the capability of communicating with other computers. 
Computers with this capability can share any of the four information processing cycle
 operation- input, process, output and storage-with another computer. </br></br>
