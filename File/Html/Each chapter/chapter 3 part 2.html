<b><u>Mainframe computer</u></b><br>
<img src="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/Mainframe computer.jpg" height="350 px" width="350 px"  style="float:left;">
A mainframe computer is a high performance computer used for large scale computing purpose that require greater security and availability. 
These computer can support  a number of terminals running concurrently serving many hundreds users without degrading its performance.
 Hence it is also called “central host computer”. Mainframe computers can be accommodated in large air-conditioned rooms because of its size.
 Mainframes can also process & store large amount of data. 
 Banks educational institutions & insurance companies use mainframe computers to store data about their customers, students & insurance policy holders.

	Fujitsu’s ICL VME</li>
<li>Hitachi’s Z800</li></ul>

<b><u>Minicomputer</u></b><br>
<img src="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/minicomputer.jpg" height="350 px" width="350 px"  style="float:right;">
A minicomputer is a type of computer that possesses most of feature and  capabilities of large computer but smaller in physical size.
 A minicomputer fills the space between the mainframe and microcomputer, and is smaller than the former but larger than the latter.
 Minicomputers are mainly used as small or mid-range servers operating business and scientific applications.
 However, the use of the term minicomputer has diminished and has merged with servers. A minicomputer may also be called a mid-range computer. 
 The examples of minicomputers are the AS/400 , the PRIME series  ,the AP-3 , Olivetti’s audit 7 and Interdata  8/32.

<b><u>Microcomputer</u></b><br>
A computer based on  a single chip  microprocessor is known as micro computer. 
The personal computer is one form. 
The power and price of a microcomputer is determined partly by the speed and power 
of the processor and partly by the characteristics of other components of the system, i.e. 
the memory, the disk units, the display, the keyboard, the flexibility of the hardware, 
and the operating system and other software. It is usually design to be operated by one person at a time. 
These are general purpose computer which can do a variety of jobs.these are commonly used in offices 
and homes as well as workstation. The two sub categories of microcomputer are:</p>
<ol class="orderlist1"><li>Desktop computer</li>
<img src="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/desktop computer.jpg" height="200 px" width="250 px"  style="float:left;">
A desktop computer is a personal computer that fits on or under a desk.
 They usually consist of a monitor, keyboard, mouse and either a horizontal or vertical(tower) 
 form factor. Unlike a laptop, which is portable, a desktop computer is meant to stay at one location. 
 Desktop models are board and low whereas tower model computer are narrow and tall. Desktop models designed to be very small  
 and are sometimes reffered to as slimline models.
<li>Portable computers</li>

A portable computer is a personal computer that is designed to be easily transported and relocated.  
The first portable computer is considered to be the IBM 5100. Portable computer by their nature are generally microcomputers. 
They are also known as lunchbox or luggable computer. They are available in two forms , they are:
</ol>
<ol class="orderlist1" type="a"><li>Laptop</li>
<img src="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/laptop.png" height="200 px" width="250 px"  style="float:right;">
A laptop computer, sometimes called a notebook computer by manufacturers,
 is a battery- or AC-powered personal computer generally smaller than a 
 briefcase that can easily be transported and conveniently used in temporary spaces 
 such as on airplanes, in libraries, temporary offices, and at meetings. 
 The advantage of laptop computer is one can used it anytime and anywhere.
<li>Palmtop</li>
A palmtop computer is a personal computer or other electronic device that has many of the same features 
as a computer and fits in the palm of your hand. A good example of an early palmtop computer is the PalmPilot .
 Because of their size early palmtop computers did not have a keyboard or a mouse and often relied off a pen 
 that used Graffiti or something similar. It can be attached to mobile phones enabling it to receive and send email.

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Hybrid computer:</i></u></p>
<img src="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/hybrid computer.jpeg" height="200 px" width="250 px"  style="float:left;">
<p class="Text">
A hybrid is a combination of digital and analog computers. 
It combines the best features of both types of computers, i-e. 
It has the speed of analog computer and the memory and accuracy of digital computer. 
Hybrid computers are used mainly in specialized applications where both kinds of data need to be processed. 
Therefore, they help the user, to process both continuous and discrete data. For example a petrol pump contains 
a processor that converts fuel flow measurements into quantity and price values. In hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU), 
an analog device is used which measures patient's blood pressure and temperature etc, which are then converted and displayed 
in the form of digits. Hybrid computers for example are used for scientific calculations, in defense and radar systems.</p>
