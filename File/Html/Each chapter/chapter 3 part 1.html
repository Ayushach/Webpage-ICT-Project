Analog computers are used to process analog data. 
Analog data is of continuous nature and which is not discrete or separate.
 Such type of data includes temperature, pressure,speed ,  weight, voltage, depth etc.
 These quantities are continuous and having an infinite variety of values.<br>
It measures continuous changes in some physical quantity e.g. 
The Speedometer of a car measures speed, the change of temperature.
 These computers are ideal in situations where data can be accepted directly from measuring instrument without having to convert it into numbers or codes.
<br>Analog computers are the first computers being developed and provided the basis for the development of the modern digital computers.
 Analog computers are widely used for certain specialized engineering and scientific applications, for calculation and measurement of analog quantities.
 They are frequently used to control process such as those found in oil refinery where flow and temperature measurements are important.
 They are used for example in paper making and in chemical industry.
 Analog computers do not require any storage capability because they measure and compare quantities in a single operation. 
 Output from an analog computer is generally in the form of readings on a series of dial (Speedometer of a car) or a graph on strip chart.

<p class="Text">
Digital computer is designed to process data in numerical form ;its circuits perform directly the mathematical operation of additions, subtraction , multiplication and division.
 It is an an electronic computer in which the input is discrete rather than continuous. 
 It  consist  combinations of numbers, letters, and other characters written in an appropriate programming language and it represented internally in binary notation.
 These can be further classified according to the difference in size ,cost , application areas and computing power. They are as follow:</p>
 <ul class="unorderlist1">
 
<li>Super computers</li>
<li>Mainframe computers</li>
<li>Minicomputers</li>
<li>Microcomputers</li></ul>

<u><b>Super computer:</b></u><br>
<img src="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/Super computer.jpg" height="350 px" width="350 px"  style="float:right;">
The most powerful computers in terms of performance and data processing are the Supercomputers.
 It is a computer that is fastest around the world , having  very large memory and high processing speed.
 They can process up to billion operation per second.
 These are specialized and task specific computers used by large organizations.
 These computer have multiple CPU that can process multiple instruction at a time, known as  parallel processing.
 These computers are used for research and exploration purposes, like NASA uses supercomputers for launching space shuttles, controlling them and for space exploration purpose
