<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Introduction:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
People lived on the earth for centuies without keeping records,
but as social organization such as tribes began to form , record keeping become necessary.
The early man use stone and pebbles for counting cattles.
Later stone were replaced by sticks , marks on the earth , scratches and symbols on stone , knots on rope etc..
He found it difficult to use to use these computing technology because it needs physical efforts 
and it's speed was slow . 
This necessitates the development of new machines for faster and better computation.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Chinese Abacus:</i></u></p>
<img src ="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/abacus.jpg" height="200 px" width="350 px" style="float:left">
<p class="Text">
Abacus was one of the earliest calculating device developed by chinese 3000 years ago. 
It is also called suanpan which means counting board.
It cosists of rectangular frame carrying a number of rods of wire.
A transverse bar divides each of these rods into 2 unequal portions.
On the upper the smaller portion of each rod are 2 beads and on the lower portion 5 beads.
Each beads in upper smaller portion has value of 5 while lower portion has value of 1.
 It is still used in some parts of the world. 
 Sometimes blind people will use an abacus, because they can feel the numbers easily.
 The most common abacus work by moving beads on rods.

<img src ="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/napiers bones.jpg" height="200 px" width="350 px" style="float:right">
<p class="Text">
A scottish mathematician called John Napier invented method logarithm in 1614.
The use of logarithm enabled him to tranform multiplication and division sums into problems of 
additions and subtraction.He called logarithm as artificial number at the beginning 
It is combination of 2 greek words  , logos meaning ratio and arthmos meaning numbers.
The invention of logarithms was inportant in development of napiers bone.<br>
Napier's bones were invented by John Napier (1550-1617).It was  a set of 11 calculating rods and each rod is further divided into 9 diagnol numbered part.
This device helped a lot in multiplication and division sums including larger number.
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Slide rule:</i></u></p>
<img src ="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/slide rule.jpg" height="200 px" width="350 px" style="float:left">
<p class="Text">
The slide rule, or slipstick is a mechanical analog computer.
The slide rule is used mainly for multiplication and division, and also for "scientific" functions 
such as roots, logarithms and trigonometry, but usually not for addition or subtraction.
William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 1620.
He invented both standard rectilinesr slide rulr and less commonly used slide rule. 
The slide rule was based on the work on logarithms by John Napier.
It has 2 movable graduated ruler kept side by side.
Each ruler has been marked off in such a way that the actual distance from beginning of the ruler
is propotional to the logarithm of the number printed in the ruler.
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Pascaline:</i></u></p>
<img src ="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/pascaline.jpg" height="200 px" width="350 px" style="float:right">
<p class="Text">
A French Mathematician called Blaise Pascal invented first mechanical calculating machine called pascaline in 1642.
It was developed to help his father who was a tax collector in calculating tax.
The machine worked with wheels , gears and dials
The numbers were entered by dialing a series of numbered wheels , where the movement of the wheels starts at 9 and moves to 0.
The disadvantage was its limitation to addition and subtraction , while multiplication and division were done by performing
series of addition or subtraction.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Stepped reckoner:</i></u></p>
<img src ="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/stepped reckoner.jpg" height="200 px" width="350 px" style="float:left">
<p class="Text">
A German mathematician Gottfriend Von Leibnitz invented stepped reckoner in 1671.
He improved pascaline by creating a machine that could perform all 4 basic mathematical
 operation such as addition , subtraction , multiplication and division.
 It could evaluate square roots by series of stepped additions.
 His nachine used stepped cylinders each with 9 teeth of varying length and introduced
 a new concept called shifting machine. Moving a digit to right orleft is called shift.
 He achieved this through a series of sliders.</p>
 <p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Jacquard's loom:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Joseph Marie Jacquard was a french silk weaver.
He invented automated loom in 1804 that used punch cards to weave and design patterns on cloth.
The function of the loom depended upon the existence of holes on the card.
Thus Jacquard's loom paved the way for the modern storage mechanism on punched cards and binary coding system.

<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Babbage's Engine(Difference and Analytical engine):</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
Charles Babbage was an english born inventor and mathematician .
He designed an automatic mechanical calculating machine called difference engine in 1823
that could solve equation by calculating differences between them.
It was fully automatic in both calculating and printing output tables.
It was controlled by a fixed instruction program that executed only in precise linear sequence.<br>
This analytical engine the first fully automatic calculating machine.
Conceived  by him in 1834 , this machine was designed to evaluate any mathematical formula and to have even higher power of analysis than  his 
original difference engine in 1820s.
Charles Babbage was honoured as the father of computer as a result of his contribution to basic design to computer.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> Lady Augusta Ada Lovelace:</i></u></p>
<img src ="../../../Document/Images/Chapters/lady augusta.jpg" height="300 px" width="250 px" style="float:right">
<p class="Text">
Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815 to November 27, 1852) was a British mathematician and computer engineer who improved upon the designs of Charles Babbage.
 Her work is considered to be the first written computer algorithm in that it contain written instructions for a machine to follow.
 In 1843 she published a translation from the french of an article on analytical engine by an Italian 
 engineer ,Luigi Menabrea to which Ada added extensive notes of her.
 The notes include  the first published description of stepwise sequence of operation 
 for solving certain mathematical operation.Ada is reffered as first programmer.
 In 1979 the Us Defence Department named a progrmamming language ADA in her honour.</p>
 <p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i> George Boole:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
George Boole was a British mathematician whose work on logic laid many of the foundations for the digital revolution.
 The Lincolnshire-born academic is widely heralded as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th century, 
 devising a system of logic that aimed to condense complex thoughts into simple equations. His development of 
 'Boolean logic' paved the way for the computer age.

His legacy was Boolean logic, a theory of mathematics in which all variables are either "true" or "false", or "on" or "off". 
The theory preceded the digital age, with American Claude Shannon applying Boolean logic to build the electrical circuits in 
the 1930s that led to modern computers.</p>
<p class="HTopic" align="left"><u><i>Tabulating machine:</i></u></p>
<p class="Text">
The tabulating machine was an electromechanical machine designed to assist in summarizing information stored on punched cards.
 Invented by Herman Hollerith, the machine was developed to help process data for the 1890 U.S. Census. Later models were widely 
 used for business applications such as accounting and inventory control. The Hollerith tabulating system was the first to make practical
 use of punch card in data processing.Hollerith started his own business in 1896 founding the tabulating machine company.
 In 1911 4 coporation including hollerith's firm merged to form  Computing Tabulating Recording(CTR).
 In 1924 CTR was renamed International Business Machine(IBM).</p>
